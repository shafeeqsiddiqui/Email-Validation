# 📧 Email Verification Project

This project focuses on validating email addresses using two distinct approaches in Python. The goal is to ensure that a given email input adheres to standard formatting rules, enhancing input validation in web forms, applications, and backend systems.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Two different email validation methods
- Clear and modular Python implementation
- Beginner-friendly logic with practical applications

---

## 🛠️ Approaches Used

### ✅ 1. Validation Using Regular Expressions (Regex)

This method utilizes Python's `re` module to validate the structure of an email address based on a predefined pattern. It ensures that the email follows standard rules like:

- Starts with alphanumeric characters (including `.` and `_`)
- Includes a valid domain name (e.g., `gmail.com`)
- Ends with a proper top-level domain (e.g., `.com`, `.org`)

**Advantages:**
- Fast and efficient
- Ideal for enforcing complex rules

### ✅ 2. Validation Using String Functions

In this approach, the email address is manually validated using Python’s built-in string functions.

This method checks the basic structure of an email without relying on external modules.

**Advantages:**
- No dependencies
- Useful for understanding core logic
